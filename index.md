I am a doctoral candidate in Economics at the [University of Groningen], Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), Department of Economics, Econometrics and Finance (EEF) since 2022. My doctoral disseration is supervised by [Gerard van den Berg] and [Bertrand Achou]
Previously, I have obtained an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] and a research master degree from the University of Groningen. 
<!-- "applied microeconometrician" for job applications
could add orcid in the future -->

My research interests are in health economics, labor economics, and public economics. In my current research projects I investigate state-dependence in disease transitions among elderly and how government policies are causally related to health outcomes. My research focuses primarily on Chinese institutional settings.
