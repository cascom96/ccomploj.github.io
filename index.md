I am a doctoral candidate in Economics at the [University of Groningen], Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB). 

My research interests are primarily in health and microeconometrics. I currently work on topics related to chronic diseases.

Prior to joining the University of Groningen, I have received an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] and a research master degree from the University of Groningen.
