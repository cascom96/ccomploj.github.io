I am an applied microeconometrician studying towards a doctoral degree in economics at the [University of Groningen], Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB). 

I work on topics related to health and labor. I currently work on topics related to health among elderly.

Prior to joining the University of Groningen, I have obtained an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] and a research master degree from the University of Groningen.
