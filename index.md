I am a doctoral candidate at the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), [University of Groningen] (The Netherlands). My doctoral advisors are [Gerard van den Berg] and [Bertrand Achou].

Previously, I have obtained an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] and a research master degree from the University of Groningen. 
<!-- I apply causal inference; "applied microeconometrician" for job applications
could add orcid in the future -->

My research interests are in health economics, labor economics, and public economics. In my current research I investigate state-dependence in disease transitions among elderly and how government policies are causally related to health outcomes. My research focuses primarily on Chinese institutional settings. 
<!-- I am an applied microeconometrician who works on the economics of aging, particularly the intersection of health, saving behavior, and social insurance. In my job market paper, I examine the determinants of long-term care use, including informal care provision, the need for care, and economic resources. -->
