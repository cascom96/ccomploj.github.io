I am an applied microeconometrician studying towards a doctoral degree in economics at the [University of Groningen], Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB). 

I primarily work on topics related to health and labor. I currently study health how elderly transition between different disease states before death using longitudinal retirement data.

Prior to joining the University of Groningen, I have obtained an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] and a research master degree from the University of Groningen.
