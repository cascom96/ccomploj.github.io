I am a doctoral candidate in Economics at the [University of Groningen]. Previously, I have obtained an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] and a research master degree from the University of Groningen.

My research interests are in health economics, labor economics, and public economics. In my ongoing research projects I investigate how state-dependence affects health transitions in old-age and how government policies causally impact health outcomes. My research primarily focuses on Chinese institutional settings.
