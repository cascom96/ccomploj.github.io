I am a doctoral candidate in Economics at the [University of Groningen] since 09/2022. Previously, I have obtained an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] and a research master degree from the University of Groningen.  
<!-- applied microeconometrician -->

My research interests are in health economics, labor economics, and public economics. In my ongoing research projects I investigate how state-dependence affects health transitions in old-age and how government policies are causally related to health outcomes. I have a strong interest in Chinese institutional settings, 

My research primarily focuses primarily on Chinese institutional settings.
