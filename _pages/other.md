HRS-type datasets are essential for aging, health, and retirement research.
"HRSg2agingToPanel.do" simplifies working with HRS-type datasets, streamlining cross-country comparative research and preserving variable labels. The file is designed to facilitate the analysis of Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and related sister surveys harmonized by the Gateway2Aging (g2aging) project (SHARE, CHARLS, ELSA, etc.). The file streamlines data preparation, reshaping wide-format data into a long-format panel, reducing the dataset to a compact dataset, keeping only the chosen variables. This facilitates cross-country economic research on elderly populations.
