	Altruism is a key professional norm that underlies the physician's role as a representative agent for patients. However, physician behavior can be influenced when private gains enter the objective function. We study the relationship between altruism and physicians' receipt of financial benefits from pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the extent to which altruism mitigates physicians' responsiveness to these industry payments. We combine data on altruistic preferences for 280 physicians, identified using a revealed preference economic experiment, with information on their receipt of monetary and in-kind transfers from pharmaceutical firms along with drug prescription claims data. Less altruistic physicians receive, on average, 2,184 USD  (95% CI: 979.3--3,388.5) higher industry transfers, translating to 254% more in monetary value, compared to physicians with stronger altruistic preferences. Moreover, we observe that industry transfers are associated with higher overall drug costs and brand prescribing rates; however, these correlations are predominantly driven by physicians with less altruistic preferences. We find limited evidence that patient vulnerability moderates industry influences among less altruistic physicians. Our results indicate that altruism is an important determinant of physiciansâ€™ relationships with and responses to industry benefits.

Cash transfers and mental health: evidence from rural China <br/>

The extent to which wealth and public policy can shape mental health outcomes has been
studied previously, but how cash transfers in the form of noncontributory pensions can, either
temporarily or permanently, alleviate mental illness remains unclear. This paper exploits the
staggered introduction of the New Rural Pension Scheme between 2009 and 2012 in rural China.
Using CHARLS data from 2011-2018, we reveal an effect of approximately 60% on pension take
up, a 900 yuan increase in yearly pension income and crowding out of transfers from children
and grandchildren.
