The extent to which wealth and public policy can shape mental health outcomes has been
studied previously, but how cash transfers in the form of noncontributory pensions can, either
temporarily or permanently, alleviate mental illness remains unclear. This paper exploits the
staggered introduction of the New Rural Pension Scheme between 2009 and 2012 in rural China.
Using CHARLS data from 2011-2018, we reveal an effect of approximately 60% on pension take
up, a 900 yuan increase in yearly pension income and crowding out of transfers from children
and grandchildren.
