This paper investigates the mental health consequences of noncontributory pensions by leveraging regional and temporal variation in implementation dates of the New Rural Pension Scheme (2009â€“2012). Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we implement a difference-in-difference strategy and compare estimates from a two-way-fixed effect specification with estimators that are robust to heterogenous treatment effects. 
Our results reveal a pension take-up of 60% among the eligible rural population, a 900-yuan rise in annual pension income, and significant crowding-out of private transfers from children and grandchildren. The results indicate that the new rural pension scheme improves mental health by reducing depressive symptoms, and provide evidence of its broader welfare implications.

### Work in Progress
Multimorbidity in SHARE and ELSA <br/>
<small>(joint with [Luigi Ferrucci], [Agar Brugiavini] and [Elisa Fabbri])</small> <br/>

<summary><small>Abstract</small></summary>
It is well established that multimorbidity increases with aging and is associated with adverse health
outcomes, including physical and cognitive disability, frailty and mortality. Using longitudinal data from more
than 25000 participants to the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)
and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), we describe the longitudinal disease trajectories of elderly 
individuals older than 50 prior to death. 
We implement a linear mixed model and a generalized ordered logit with flexible coefficients across thresholds,
and find that the probability within individuals to develop an additional disease accelerates with the 
current disease count. Heterogeneity analyses suggest that individuals who experienced the first disease onset 
at older ages present a more rapid health deterioration. We do not find evidence of any disease clusters.

<small>
It is well established that multimorbidity increases with aging and is associated with adverse health outcomes, including physical and cognitive disability, frailty and mortality. However, the dynamic development of multimorbidity accumulation and its relationship with aging and other predictors has never been evaluated in a large dataset representative of the pouplation. Using rich panel data with health and labor market histories from more than 15,000 individuals followed over a period of 20 years from the Health and Retirement Study in the United States, we study the deterioration of health using a summary index of chronic disease from the first onset of a chronic disease (the end of the `health expectancy') until death. We model latent health by groups of socioeconomic status using an ordered response model in which transition probabilities between different states of frailty, or disease states, are dependent on the first disease onset, health history and health types. We examine the issue of state dependence in health trajectories and model health transitions as a flexible Markov process.
